**Requirements**

**Introduction**

- Mathematical operations are a part of our daily lives. Every day we will be involving with various types of calculations around us. Matrices are a mathematical entity where numbers are arranged in rows and columns. A lot of applications exist with matrices in real life. The major application lies in the software industry such as development of algorithms like path finder algorithms, image processing algorithms and many more.
- In this project, some of the basic matrix operations are presented where a user can select the operation to be performed on the matrix. Then the matrices with their size are entered. Note that only square matrices are being considered for the project.

**Research**

**Objective**

This project focuses on matrix operations on square matrices. The operations performed on a pair of square matrices are, addition, subtraction and multiplication. The operations performed on a single square matrix are, transpose, determinant and inverse.

**Benefits**

A user who is working on a laptop or a desktop, who would be working on matrix based calculations, can make use of this application as handy. A human being can find the output values of a matrix for a maximum of size 3 X 3, i.e. 3 rows and 3 columns. If they try to solve the matrix for dimensions above 3, the time consumed is large and verification that the solution is corrects or not consumes extra time. Hence this tool can be used to cross check the matrix operations conducted.

**Cost and Features**

- The cost for implementing a project involving matrix calculations is minimal to none. But the extension of matrix applications to various state of the art domains like machine learning, image processing, cryptography, path finder algorithms etc will have a research and development being done. And for the required calculations related to matrices, this program comes in handy.
